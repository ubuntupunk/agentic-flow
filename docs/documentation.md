- Label management (create, delete, apply)
- Priority-based email organization

### 3. Search Capabilities
- Fuzzy search for quick lookups
- Semantic search using vector embeddings
- Combined search mode for best results
- Real-time search suggestions

### 4. AI-Powered Features

#### Email Analysis
- Sentiment analysis
- Topic extraction
- Entity recognition
- Urgency detection
- Action item identification

#### Smart Categorization
- Automatic email categorization (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, Forums)
- ML-based label suggestions
- Content-based priority assignment

#### Smart Replies
- Context-aware reply suggestions
- Sentiment-based response generation
- Confidence scoring for suggestions

#### Calendar Integration
- Automatic event detection
- ICS file generation
- Attendee extraction
- Location recognition

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TipTap for rich text editing
- Lucide React for icons

### AI/ML Components
- @xenova/transformers for ML models
- Compromise.js for NLP tasks
- Vector storage for semantic search
- Fuse.js for fuzzy search

### Email Processing
- Gmail API integration
- MIME message parsing
- Attachment handling
- Calendar event processing

### Data Models

#### Email Interface
```typescript
interface Email {
  id: string;
  from: string;
  to: string[];
  subject: string;
  body: string;
  date: Date;
  labels: string[];
  priority: 'high' | 'normal' | 'low';
  category?: EmailCategory;
}
```

#### Contact Interface
```typescript
interface Contact {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  organization?: string;
  lastInteraction?: Date;
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Email Categorization
The system uses a fine-tuned BERT model to categorize emails into predefined categories:
- Primary: Personal and important communications
- Social: Messages from social networks
- Promotions: Marketing emails
- Updates: Notifications and updates
- Forums: Discussion groups and mailing lists

### Smart Reply Generation
Implements a T5-based model for generating contextually appropriate replies:
- Analyzes email content and tone
- Generates multiple response options
- Ranks responses by relevance
- Provides confidence scores

### Calendar Event Detection
Uses natural language processing to identify and extract event information:
- Date and time recognition
- Location extraction
- Attendee identification
- Event title generation

### Vector Search Implementation
- Converts emails into vector embeddings
- Stores embeddings in an efficient vector database
- Enables semantic similarity search
- Combines with traditional search methods

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- OAuth2 flow for secure authentication
- Secure token storage
- Regular token rotation

### Data Privacy
- Client-side processing where possible
- Minimal data storage
- Secure API communication

## Performance Optimizations

### Search
- Debounced search inputs
- Cached search results
- Optimized vector operations
- Parallel search execution

### UI/UX
- Virtualized lists for email display
- Lazy loading of email content
- Progressive loading of attachments
- Optimistic UI updates

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Advanced thread analysis
- Email scheduling system
- Template management
- Contact relationship mapping
- Advanced attachment handling
- Email analytics dashboard

### Potential Improvements
- Additional email provider support
- Enhanced ML model performance
- Offline support
- Mobile optimization
- Advanced collaboration features

## API Documentation

### Gmail API Integration
```typescript
class GmailAPI {
  async listEmails(filters: EmailFilter): Promise<Email[]>
  async sendEmail(email: EmailData): Promise<void>
  async createLabel(name: string): Promise<void>
  async deleteLabel(id: string): Promise<void>
}
```

### Search API
```typescript
class SearchEngine {
  async fuzzySearch(query: string): Promise<Email[]>
  async semanticSearch(query: string): Promise<Email[]>
  async combinedSearch(query: string): Promise<Email[]>
}
```

### ML Services
```typescript
class EmailAnalyzer {
  async analyzeEmail(email: Email): Promise<EmailAnalysis>
  async generateSmartReplies(email: Email): Promise<SmartReply[]>
  async extractEvents(email: Email): Promise<CalendarEvent[]>
}
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Strict TypeScript usage
- Functional component patterns
- Custom hook abstractions
- Consistent error handling

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities
- Integration tests for API
- E2E tests for critical flows
- Performance benchmarks

### State Management
- React Query for server state
