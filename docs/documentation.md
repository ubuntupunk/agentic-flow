### Email Providers
- Base email provider interface
- Gmail API integration
- IMAP support
- Offline storage sync

### Offline Storage
- IndexedDB for local storage
- Email caching
- Contact management
- Task storage
- Sync state tracking

### AI/ML Components
- @xenova/transformers for ML models
- Compromise.js for NLP tasks
- Vector storage for semantic search
- Fuse.js for fuzzy search

### Email Processing
- Gmail API integration
- IMAP message handling
- MIME message parsing
- Attachment handling
- Calendar event processing

### Data Models

#### Email Interface
```typescript
interface Email {
  id: string;
  from: string;
  to: string[];
  subject: string;
  body: string;
  date: Date;
  labels: string[];
  priority: 'high' | 'normal' | 'low';
  category?: EmailCategory;
}
```

#### Contact Interface
```typescript
interface Contact {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  organization?: string;
  lastInteraction?: Date;
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Email Provider System
The application uses a flexible email provider system that supports multiple email services:

```typescript
abstract class BaseEmailProvider {
  abstract connect(): Promise<void>;
  abstract disconnect(): Promise<void>;
  abstract listEmails(filter: EmailFilter): Promise<Email[]>;
  abstract sendEmail(email: EmailData): Promise<void>;
  abstract createLabel(name: string): Promise<void>;
  abstract deleteLabel(id: string): Promise<void>;
  abstract sync(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Offline Storage
Implements a comprehensive offline storage system using IndexedDB:

```typescript
class OfflineStorage {
  async initialize(): Promise<void>;
  async saveEmail(email: Email): Promise<void>;
  async getEmail(id: string): Promise<Email | undefined>;
  async getAllEmails(): Promise<Email[]>;
  async searchEmails(query: string): Promise<Email[]>;
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- OAuth2 flow for secure authentication
- Secure token storage
- Regular token rotation
- Multiple provider authentication support

### Data Privacy
- Client-side processing where possible
- Minimal data storage
- Secure API communication
- Encrypted offline storage

## Performance Optimizations

### Search
- Debounced search inputs
- Cached search results
- Optimized vector operations
- Parallel search execution
- Offline search capabilities

### UI/UX
- Virtualized lists for email display
- Lazy loading of email content
- Progressive loading of attachments
- Optimistic UI updates
- PWA for offline access

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Advanced thread analysis
- Email scheduling system
- Template management
- Contact relationship mapping
- Advanced attachment handling
- Email analytics dashboard

### Potential Improvements
- Additional email provider support
